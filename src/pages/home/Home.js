          <b>Why is this so ?</b>
        </h3>
        <p >
          Let's discuss first problem, first. why we have to pay-out-of-pocket.
          is because of lack of financial planning, education, income or
          something else much more bigger than these? My opinionated answer is
          these factor have significat contribution but these all are secondary
          to problem. One reason is that spending on Healthcare is always
          unpredicatbe. You can't even estimate the upper and lower limit of
          your Healthcare spending. This spending doesn't comes with choice
          whether we spend or not. This unpridictability ruines millions of
          families per day basis, takes them down generations behind, some time
          it makes situation so severe families strugle to feed themselves. This
          seems extreme but it's not common countries like India. <hr></hr> So
          what can we do to slove? now let's see When I talking about the
          predicatability one thing comes our mind is that Can AI
          pridict/estimate our monthy/yearly spending on Healthcare. My answer
          is conflicting somewhat AI may or may not able to pridict. Eventhough
          AI managed to pridict the monthy/Yearly expediture on Healthcare of
          whole family or specific Individual. who will pay the bills ?. In
          India 60% population lives in rural area and have lower income but
          same time the Healthcare is very expensive due to high Competition and
          deficit in Healthcare professionals, large population ....and so on.

          <b>Now, the Real Problem start here!</b>
        </h3>
        <p >
          We need Solution which gives access to funds(financial Aid) within
          justifiable duration in the circumstances where you need to pay Out of
          Pocket. <b>Do we need to invent the Wheel for this? </b>. the answer
          is Big No. Acuatally Solution is already there in the system but
          because of some severe challenges people can't see and access it. some
          who able to see but can't use it whenever the need because of rigid,
          rough, long and unpridictable nature of system and loose thier trust
          on the system start bad mouthing the system.

          So what is the exiting Solution, How we can make it more usable and

          but what .. wh.. what Health Insurnace ðŸ¤”. I can understand your
          emotions ðŸ˜Š. Let me make my point. To do so allow me to give you quick
          64000 fit picture of Healthcare Industry and it's actors. Healthcare
          Market become complex Ecosystem with lots of actors. Each actor has to
          fight for 2 forces of market:
          <b> maximizing profit and fight for Competition</b>. Each actor
          incentivize their Dependent(supplier and Venders) actors to win the
          Competition and maximize profit. Example - every pharma company has to
          convince providers(Doctors) to prescribe their new drug and has to
          negotiate with Insurnace Companies to add thier new drug in the
          Insured Drug list. Some times theses companies can be aggresive in
          their sales efforts which create tension among other actors primarily
          with patient. These incentives and tensions create complex Ecosystem
          which lead to dilemmas and Skepticism to see clearer picture and solve
          problems. Let break this barrier and visualize 64000 fit abstract view
          of Healthcare Industry.

          Now, you can see the Big picture. Patient, provider and
          Payors(Insurnace companies) are the Big Important 3. Insurance
          Business is about taking risk to reduce other's risk of Business,
          Machinery, Investment,falling sick ... etc. These companies have
          strong core competency in financial Markets and uses mathematical laws
          like "Law of large numbers" and probability to quantify and predict
          the possibilty of number of people falling sick out of monthly/yearly
          sold premiums. Making sure the net sum must be positive(profit).
          Insurance works pretty fine so why we are still facing problems like
          families go broke beacause of unexpected expediture of Healthcare. The
          answer is these companies need to solve vital problems before
